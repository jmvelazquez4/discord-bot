# discord-bot
This bot uses Tesseract OCR to analyze Wild Rift screenshots of the in-game guild menu. It will store usernames and their associated contribution.

Requirements
These files are written in Javascript. You will need to put your own config.js file and everything else should work. 

Work In Progress
Some parts are still a WIP. Member/Admin configuration is still being worked on as well as UI configuration.
